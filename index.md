I took some kids to a nearby lake where we made a fire on the ice and made s'mores. I also really like chocolate and graham crackers, but dislike marshmellows. After the fire the kids buried each other. I helped.

This winter sometimes I would ski on my lunch break at work. I played on this hill on a day we had some nice fresh snow.

This is a hot spring in California we loved. We came here a couple mornings. The water was pretty hot and the mornings were cool, clear, and quiet.
