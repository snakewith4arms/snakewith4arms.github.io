# Last weekend...
I took some kids to a nearby lake where we made a fire on the ice and made s'mores. I also really like chocolate and graham crackers, but dislike marshmellows. After the fire the kids buried each other. I helped. ![Buried Alive!!!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80181083/110267552-ae810100-7f85-11eb-9cad-24c076580a62.jpg)

# Some neat pictures...
This winter sometimes I would ski on my lunch break at work. I played on this hill on a day we had some nice fresh snow. ![ski tracks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80181083/110267063-ac6a7280-7f84-11eb-8190-aae28772a39e.jpg)
