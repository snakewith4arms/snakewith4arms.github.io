### Hi Dragoncat,
### I hope you had a good week. I'm interested to hear what you've been up to. What are you reading? What is school like for you? Are you doing school at home, at school, or a mix? My kids are now in school all week for the first time in a long time. They're happier being there with their friends but we all worry about people getting sick with covid. Quite a few teachers and others who work at at the school have been vaccinated.

### Part of my spouse's job is setting up clinics where they vaccinate lots of people. Last week their clinics vaccinated about 2000 people in Wright County where we live. One of my kids is part of a clinical trial to get a vaccine approved for use by teenagers. He gets paid for it, but it requires some blood draws and quite a few nose swabs. Have you had a covid test? I had my first one this week. The nose swab was really uncomfortable but not as bad as I feared.

### Do you like to ride bikes? It's something I really like. I'm bummed that the snow is melting so I won't be able to ski anymore, but at least riding bikes is nicer without the snow and ice on the ground. I fixed up some bikes for my kids this weekend. I work on bikes quite a bit.

### Do you like playing frisbee? I played some frisbee yesterday and today. Frisbee golf is one of my favorite things. Have you ever played that?

### Take care,
### Snake



#### Some neat pictures...

I took some kids to a nearby lake where we made a fire on the ice and made s'mores. I also really like chocolate and graham crackers, but dislike marshmallows. After the fire the kids buried each other. I helped.

This winter sometimes I would ski on my lunch break at work. I played on this hill on a day we had some nice fresh snow.

This is a hot spring in California we loved. We came here a couple mornings. The water was pretty hot and the mornings were cool, clear, and quiet.
