### Hi Dragoncat,
### I hope you had a good week. I'm interested to hear what you've been up to. What are you reading? What is school like for you? Are you doing school at home, at school, or a mix? My kids are now in school all week for the first time in a long time. They're happier being there with their friends but we all worry about people getting sick with covid. Quite a few teachers and others who work at at the school have been vaccinated.

### Part of my spouse's job is setting up clinics where they vaccinate lots of people. Last week their clinics vaccinated about 2000 people in Wright County where we live. One of my kids is part of a clinical trial to get a vaccine approved for use by teenagers. He gets paid for it, but it requires some blood draws and quite a few nose swabs. Have you had a covid test? I had my first one this week. The nose swab was really uncomfortable but not as bad as I feared.
